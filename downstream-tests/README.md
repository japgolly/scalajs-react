These are tests that rely on a locally-published version of scalajs-react.

### How does it work?

The tests are executed outside of sbt via the `./run` script.

Execute `./run -n` to see the test commands.

### What does it do?

For each test, sbt runs the custom `cleanTestAll` task which does the following:

  * the `jvm` module tests:
    * the JS generated by the `main` branch (as opposed to `test`) of the `js` module, making sure certain bits of code and present or removed by ScalaJS and related compile-time macros (according to system props)

  * the `js` module tests:
    * semver compatibility (aka MIMA)
    * other runtime tests (based on system props)

  * the `jsCE` module tests:
    * Cats Effect as the default effect library

  * the `jsCBIO` module tests:
    * scalajs-react's Callbacks as the default effect library
