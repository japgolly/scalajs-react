## 2.0.1

### New stuff

* Added `Reusability` for:
  * `java.math.BigDecimal`
  * `java.math.BigInteger`
  * `scala.math.BigDecimal`
  * `scala.math.BigInt`

* You can now `import Reusability.DecimalImplicitsWithoutTolerance._` if you'd like implicit `Reusability` instances for decimal types that use exact comparison

### Bug fixes

* Fix infinite loop in functional components with reuse + `Reusability.never` ([#1027](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/issues/1027))
* When using `cats.effect.IO` as event handlers, it runs as synchronously as possible until it runs into an async step.
