## 1.2.2

* Add ability to create JsFnComponents from Scala fns (without boxing props).
  New methods:

  ```scala
  // High-level

  JsFnComponent.fromScala             [P <: js.Object](props             => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.fromScala.withChildren[P <: js.Object]((props, children) => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.fromScala.justChildren                (children          => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.fromScala.byName                      (                  => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.fromScala.const                       (                     VdomElement)

  // Low-level

  JsFnComponent.fromScala.generic[P <: js.Object, C <: Children](P with RAW.PropsWithChildren => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.fromJsFn         [P <: js.Object, C <: Children](js.Function1[P with raw.Children, raw.React.Element])
  ```

* Add ability to turn any component into a new `JsFnComponent` one that wraps it by calling `.toJsComponent`.
  The component's props either need to be a subtype of `js.Object` or a known singleton like `Unit` or `Null`.
  <br>*(Full example in link below.)*

* Added instructions and examples for using Scala components in JS and JSX to the [Interoperability doc](../INTEROP.md).

* Bugfix: In `Broadcaster` in extra, the `unregister` function would actually make the subject the sole listener
  rather than remove it. Unfortunately there was a bug in μTest which let this slip through the gaps.
  Versions affected: 1.2.[0-1].
