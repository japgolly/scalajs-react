# 1.7.7

This entire release is new features around `AsyncCallback`.

<br>

## `AsyncCallback` instances

* Added `.fork` and `.fork_` which run the async computation in the background.

  The result of `fork` gives you access to `(await: AsyncCallback[A], isComplete: CallbackTo[Boolean])` which you can
  use to join back up with it again later.

  `fork_` on the other hand, returns nothing and is effectively fire-and-forget.

* Added duration measuring methods that exist on `Callback`:

  ```scala
  def withDuration[B](f: (A, FiniteDuration) => AsyncCallback[B]): AsyncCallback[B]
  def logDuration    (fmt: FiniteDuration => String)             : AsyncCallback[A]
  def logDuration    (name: String)                              : AsyncCallback[A]
  def logDuration                                                : AsyncCallback[A]
  ```

<br>

## `AsyncCallback` object

* Added `def awaitAll(as: AsyncCallback[_]*): AsyncCallback[Unit]` to wait for a number of async processes to complete.

* Added `.countDownLatch(count: Int)` which returns an `AsyncCallback.CountDownLatch`.
  It has the same purpose and semantics as Java's `CountDownLatch`.

  ```scala
  AsyncCallback.CountDownLatch {
    val countDown : Callback
    val await     : AsyncCallback[Unit]
    val isComplete: CallbackTo[Boolean]
    val pending   : CallbackTo[Int]
  }
  ```

* Added `.mutex` which returns a `AsyncCallback.Mutex`:

  ```scala
  AsyncCallback.Mutex {

    /** Wrap a AsyncCallback so that it executes in the mutex.
      *
      * Note: THIS IS NOT RE-ENTRANT. Calling this from within the mutex will block.
      */
    def apply[A](ac: AsyncCallback[A]): AsyncCallback[A]
  }
  ```

* Added `.readWriteMutex` which returns a `AsyncCallback.ReadWriteMutex`:

  ```scala
  AsyncCallback.ReadWriteMutex {

    /** Wrap a AsyncCallback so that it executes in the write-mutex.
      * There can only be one writer active at one time.
      *
      * Note: THIS IS NOT RE-ENTRANT. Calling this from within the read or write mutex will block.
      */
    def write[A](ac: AsyncCallback[A]): AsyncCallback[A]

    /** Wrap a AsyncCallback so that it executes in the read-mutex.
      * There can be many readers active at one time.
      *
      * Note: Calling this from within the write-mutex will block.
      */
    def read[A](ac: AsyncCallback[A]): AsyncCallback[A]
  }
  ```

* Added `ref[A](allowStaleReads = false, atomicWrites = true)` which returns a `AsyncCallback.Ref`.
  A ref is effectively a "wrapper" for mutable variable. By default, setters and getters are atomic.

  ```scala
  AsyncCallback.Ref[A] {
    val get           : AsyncCallback[A]
    val getIfAvailable: CallbackTo[Option[A]]

    def set     (a: => A)            : AsyncCallback[Unit]
    def setSync (c: CallbackTo[A])   : AsyncCallback[Unit]
    def setAsync(c: AsyncCallback[A]): AsyncCallback[Unit]

    def setIfUnset     (a: => A)            : AsyncCallback[Boolean]
    def setIfUnsetSync (c: CallbackTo[A])   : AsyncCallback[Boolean]
    def setIfUnsetAsync(c: AsyncCallback[A]): AsyncCallback[Boolean]
  }
  ```

* You can now add a `_` suffix to the following to return an `AsyncCallback[Unit]` and be more efficient under-the-hood:

  * `.traverse`
  * `.sequence`
  * `.traverseOption`
  * `.sequenceOption`

* The argument to `.throwException` is now by-name

* Added `def throwExceptionWhenDefined(o: => Option[Throwable]): AsyncCallback[Unit]`

<br>

## `AsyncCallback.Barrier`

* Added `isComplete: CallbackTo[Boolean]` to synchronously query whether the barrier is complete or not.

* Renamed `waitForCompletion` to `await`.

  `waitForCompletion` is still available but will result in a deprecation warning.
  Automatic migration is below.

## Migration

```sh
find . -type f -name '*.scala' -exec perl -pi -e '
  s/\bwaitForCompletion\b/await/g;
' {} +
```
