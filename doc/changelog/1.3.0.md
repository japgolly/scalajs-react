## 1.3.0

* The `.getDOMNode` callback can sometimes execute when unmounted which is an increasingly annoying bug to track down
  since React 16 with its new burn-it-all-down error handling approach. This release adjusts the types to restore
  compile-time safety. Unfortunately it's a breaking change. There is now a proper ADT:

  ```
                  ComponentDom
                        ↑
               ComponentDom.Mounted
                  ↑            ↑
  ComponentDom.Element      ComponentDom.Text
  ```

  Within lifecycle calls. `.getDOMNode` returns a `ComponentDom.Mounted` logically equivalent to before,
  where as the `.getDOMNode` on a mounted / backend scope now returns `ComponentDom` which might not be mounted.
  See the source for all available methods but you'll typically call one of the following methods:

  ```scala
  trait ComponentDom {
    def mounted  : Option[ComponentDom.Mounted]
    def toElement: Option[dom.Element]
    def toText   : Option[dom.Text]
  ```

  In unit tests you'll typically use `asMounted().asElement()` or `asMounted().asText()` for inspection.


## Migration

```sh
find . -path '*/test/scala/*.scala' -type f -exec perl -pi -e '
  s/getDOMNode.asElement/getDOMNode.asMounted().asElement()/g;
  s/getDOMNode.asText/getDOMNode.asMounted().asText()/g;
  s/getDOMNode.domCast/getDOMNode.asMounted().domCast/g;
  ' {} +
```
