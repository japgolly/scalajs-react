## 2.1.0

### New Stuff

* Added `NonEmptyRef` which works the same way as `Ref`, except that the reference always contains an an initialised value.
  This is the case with refs created via Hooks' `useRef`.

* Refs now have implicit `Reusability`. Because refs are references to a mutable variable that doesn't trigger any React events when modified, only the reference *handle*/*identity* is considered for reusability and not the variable's value.

### Fixes

* When using hooks, `useRef` can now be combined with `renderWithReuse` [#1037](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/issues/1037)

### Dependencies

* Upgrade Scala.js to 1.8.0
* Upgrade Cats to 2.7.0
