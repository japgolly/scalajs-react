Setup
=====

1. Add [scalajs-bundler](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalajs-bundler/getting-started.html) to your project.

2. Add *scalajs-react* to SBT:

  ```scala
  // core = essentials only. No bells or whistles.
  libraryDependencies += "com.github.japgolly.scalajs-react" %%% "core" % "0.11.3"
  ```

Creating Virtual-DOM
====================

scalajs-react uses a specialised copy of
[@lihaoyi](https://twitter.com/li_haoyi)'s [Scalatags](https://github.com/lihaoyi/scalatags)
to build virtual DOM.

There are two built-in ways of creating virtual-DOM.

1. **Prefixed (recommended)** - Importing DOM tags and attributes under prefixes is recommended. Apart from essential implicit conversions, only two names are imported: `<` for tags, `^` for attributes.

  ```scala
  import japgolly.scalajs.react.vdom.prefix_<^._

  <.ol(
    ^.id     := "my-list",
    ^.lang   := "en",
    ^.margin := "8px",
    <.li("Item 1"),
    <.li("Item 2"))
  ```

2. **Global** - You can import all DOM tags and attributes into the global namespace. Beware that doing so means that you will run into confusing error messages and IDE refactoring issues when you use names like `id`, `a`, `key` for your variables and parameters.

  ```scala
  import japgolly.scalajs.react.vdom.all._

  ol(
    id     := "my-list",
    lang   := "en",
    margin := "8px",
    li("Item 1"),
    li("Item 2"))
  ```

#### Event Handlers

There are two ways of attaching event handlers to your virtual DOM.

1. **`<attribute> --> <callback>`**

  `<attribute>` is a DOM attribute like `onClick`, `onChange`, etc.<br>
  `<callback>` is a `Callback` (see below) which doesn't need any input.

  ```scala
  def onButtonPressed: Callback =
    Callback.alert("The button was pressed!")

  <.button(
    ^.onClick --> onButtonPressed,
    "Press me!")
  ```

2. **`<attribute> ==> <handler>`**

  `<attribute>` is a DOM attribute like `onClick`, `onChange`, etc.<br>
  `<handler>` is a `ReactEvent => Callback`.<br>
  `ReactEvent` can be more specific - event types are described in [TYPES.md](TYPES.md).

  ```scala
  def onTextChange(e: ReactEventI): Callback =
    Callback.alert("Value received = " + e.target.value)

  <.input(
    ^.`type`    := "text",
    ^.value     := currentValue,
    ^.onChange ==> onTextChange)
  ```

  If your handler needs additional arguments, use currying so that the args you want to specify are on the left and the event is alone on the right.

  ```scala
  def onTextChange(desc: String)(e: ReactEventI): Callback =
    Callback.alert(s"Value received for ${desc} = ${e.target.value}")

  <.input(
    ^.`type`    := "text",
    ^.value     := currentValue,
    ^.onChange ==> onTextChange("name"))
  ```

A helpful way to remember which operator to use is to visualise the arrow stem:
<br>`==>` - The `========` has a gap in the middle - it's a pipe for data to come through meaning it expects `? => Callback`.
<br>`-->` - The `--------` has no gap - it's just a wire to a `Callback`.


#### Optional markup

* `boolean ?= markup` - Ignores `markup` unless `boolean` is `true`.

  ```scala
  def hasFocus: Boolean = ???

  <.div(
    hasFocus ?= (^.color := "green"),
    "I'm green when focused.")
  ```

* Attributes, styles, and tags can be wrapped in `Option` or `js.UndefOr` to make them optional.

  ```scala
  val loggedInUser: Option[User] = ???

  <.div(
    <.h3("Welcome"),
    loggedInUser.map(user =>
      <.a(
        ^.href := user.profileUrl,
        "My Profile")))
  ```

* Callbacks can be made optional by adding a `?` to the `-->`/`==>` op, and
  wrapping the callback in `Option` or `js.UndefOr`.

  ```scala
  val currentValue: Option[String] = ???

  def onTextChange(e: ReactEventI): Option[Callback] =
    currentValue.map { before =>
      def after = e.target.value
      Callback.alert(s"Value changed from [$before] to [$after]")
    }

  <.input(
    ^.`type`     := "text",
    ^.value      := currentValue.getOrElse(""),
    ^.onChange ==>? onTextChange)
  ```

* `EmptyTag` - A virtual DOM building block representing nothing.

  ```scala
  <.div(if (allowEdit) editButton else EmptyTag)
  ```

#### Custom markup elements

The vdom imports will add string extension methods that allow you to create you own custom tags, attributes and styles.

```scala
val customAttr  = "customAttr" .reactAttr
val customStyle = "customStyle".reactStyle
val customTag   = "customTag"  .reactTag

// Produces: <customTag customAttr="hello" style="customStyle:123;">bye</customTag>
customTag(customAttr := "hello", customStyle := "123", "bye")
```
↳ produces ↴
```html
<customTag customAttr="hello" style="customStyle:123;">bye</customTag>
```


Callbacks
=========

A callback is a procedure that is:
* meant to be run by an event handler or React lifecycle method (as opposed to on the main thread or in a `render` method).
* repeatable. It can be run more than once.
* Is pure (does nothing) in its construction. If you create a `Callback` but never run it, no action or effects should occur.

Callbacks are represented by:
* `Callback` which doesn't return a result.
* `CallbackTo[A]` which returns an `A`.

Actually `Callback` is `CallbackTo[Unit]` with a different companion object, full of different goodies that all return `Unit`.

You can create callbacks in a number of ways:

* By wrapping your code:

  ```scala
  // This is Callback. It is also a CallbackTo[Unit].
  Callback{ println("Hello! I'll be executed later.") }

  // This is a CallbackTo[Int].
  CallbackTo(123)
  ```

* When your component modifies its state via `.setState` or `.modState`, you are provided a `Callback` for the operation.

  ```scala
  componentScope.modState(_.copy(name = newName)) // returns a Callback
  ```

* Using one of the `Callback` object convenience methods

  ```scala
  // Convenience for calling `dom.console.log`.
  Callback.log("Hello Console reader.")

  // Provides both compile-time and runtime warnings that a callback isn't implemented yet.
  Callback.TODO("AJAX not implemented yet")

  // Return a pure value without doing anything
  CallbackTo.pure(0)
  ```

`Callback` also has all kinds of useful methods and combinators. Examples:
* Join callbacks together with many methods like `map`, `flatMap`, `tap`, `flatTap`, and all the squigglies that
  you may be used to in Haskell and inspired libraries like `*>`, `<*`, `>>`, `<<`, `>>=`, etc.
* `.attempt` to catch any error in the callback and handle it.
* `.async`/`.delay(n)` to run asynchronously and return a `Future`.
* `.logResult` to print the callback result before returning it.
* `.logDuration` to measure and log how long the callback takes.

There are other useful methods not listed here.
<br>Have a brief look through the source:
[Callback.scala](../core/src/main/scala/japgolly/scalajs/react/Callback.scala).

Once you have a `Callback` you can run it manually if you need, by calling `.runNow()`.
It isn't necessary and you shouldn't do it because scalajs-react handles it for you to ensure things run at the right time
on the right threads, but if you ever want to, you can.

#### Fusion via `>>`

The `>>` operator deserves a special mention as it's commonly useful.
It's used to fuse to callbacks together sequentially.
It's like a pure version of `;` which is how you sequence statements imperatively.

```scala
def greet: Callback =
  Callback {
    println("Hello.")
    println("Goodbye.")
  }

// This ↑ is equivalent to this ↓

def greet: Callback = {
  val hello = Callback(println("Hello."))
  val bye   = Callback(println("Goodbye."))
  hello >> bye
}

// which is equivalent to this ↓

def greet: Callback = {
  val hello = Callback(println("Hello."))
  val bye   = Callback(println("Goodbye."))
  hello.flatMap(_ => bye)
}
```

If you're wondering why `>>`, it's a convention used in various other monadic libraries.
I like to read it like a pipeline where the arrows show control flow.
This ↓ shows that `a` is run, then it flows right to run `b`, then flows right to run `c`.

```scala
a >> b >> c
```

Now let me also introduce `>>=` which is an alias for `flatMap`. As we know, `flatMap` takes an argument. The signature in a `CallbackTo[A]` is `def flatMap[B](f: A => CallbackTo[B]): CallbackTo[B]`. Now consider this example:

```scala
a >> b >>= c
```

It still looks like a pipeline but this time there is a `=` symbol popping out which you could imagine spits out a value.
The flow is still intact (`a` to `b` to `c`) except this time we know that `c` takes the output of `b`. If we expand that example into real code, it looks like this:

```scala
val a = Callback(println("Start"))
val b = CallbackTo(300)
val c = (i: Int) => Callback(println("Input = " + i))

val x = a >> b >>= c

x.runNow()
// Start
// Input = 300
```

#### Monadic Learning Curve

Working with `Callback`/`CallbackTo` might seem odd if you're not used to capturing effects with monads, but it's a transferable skill with applications outside of `Callback` itself.

If you'd like to learn more about this approach, see *How to declare an imperative* by Philip Wadler.
<br>A summary is available here: https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~pbv/aulas/tapf/slides/imperative.html

A direct example of how *this* connects to *that*, is the **Equational reasoning** example.
<br>Say we have a callback that prints "ha" twice to display "haha".

```scala
val haha1 = Callback(print("ha")) >> Callback(print("ha"))
```

because `Callback` is referentially-transparent, and is the representation of an action instead of the result of an action,
we can do reduce duplication by doing this:

```scala
val ha = Callback(print("ha"))
val haha2 = ha >> ha
```

Because equational reasoning holds, both callbacks are equivalent.
```
scala> haha1.runNow()
haha
scala> haha2.runNow()
haha
```

If you're getting started and find monads hard, remember you can start by just wrapping your imperative code.
So instead of:
```scala
def speak(): Unit = {
  println("Hello!")
  println("Goodbye...")
}
```
you can wrap it like:
```scala
def speak = Callback {
  println("Hello!")
  println("Goodbye...")
}
```

Notice that we change `speak()` into `speak` as it's now pure.
<br>Also be careful to call `.runNow()` on any inner callbacks if you take this approach. If you don't, scalac will just throw it away without executing it which is probably not what you want -- Scala does all kinds of nasty things when `Unit` is involved which is what `;` does between imperative statements.

It's actually recommended that you *not* take this approach and instead, use proper operators to combine callbacks as the compiler will be able to offer help and catch problems.


Creating Components
===================

Provided is a component builder DSL called `ReactComponentB`.

You throw types and functions at it, call `build` and when it compiles you will have a React component.

You first specify your component's properties type, and a component name.
```scala
ReactComponentB[Props]("MyComponent")
```

Next you keep calling functions on the result until you get to a `build` method.

*(Note: There's a little bit of magic under the covers when you call `.build`, that checks if your props type is `Unit` and if it is, provides your component with a different constructor so that you don't have to always pass in `()`.)*

For a list of available methods, let your IDE guide you or see the
[source](../core/src/main/scala/japgolly/scalajs/react/ReactComponentB.scala).

The result of the `build` function will be an object that acts like a class.
You must create an instance of it to use it in vdom.

(`ReactComponent` types are described in [TYPES.md](TYPES.md).)

Example (with props):
```scala
val Hello =
  ReactComponentB[String]("Hello")
    .render_P(name => <.div("Hello there ", name))
    .build

// Usage:
Hello("Draconus")
```

Example (without props):
```scala
val NoArgs =
  ReactComponentB[Unit]("No args")
    .render(_ => <.div("Hello!"))
    .build

// Usage:
NoArgs()
```

#### Backends

In addition to props and state, if you look at the React samples you'll see that most components need additional functions
and even, (in the case of React's second example, the timer example), state outside of the designated state object (!).
In plain React with JS, functions which can have access to the component's props and state
(such as helpers fns and event handlers),
are placed within the body of the component class.
In scalajs-react you need another place for such functions as scalajs-react
emphasises type-safety and provides different types for the component's scope at different points in the lifecycle.
Instead they should be placed in some arbitrary class you may provide, called a *backend*.

See the [online timer demo](http://japgolly.github.io/scalajs-react/#examples/timer) for an example.

For the extremely common case of having a backend class with a render method, `ReactComponentB` comes with a `.renderBackend` method.
It will locate the `render` method, determine what the arguments need (props/state/propsChildren) by examining the
types or the arg names when the types are ambiguous, and create the appropriate function at compile-time.
If can also automate the creation of the backend, see below.

Before:
```scala
type State = Vector[String]

class Backend($: BackendScope[Unit, State]) {
  def render = {
    val s = $.state
    <.div(
      <.div(s.length, " items found:"),
      <.ol(s.map(i => <.li(i))))
  }
}

val Example = ReactComponentB[Unit]("Example")
  .initialState(Vector("hello", "world"))
  .backend(new Backend(_))
  .render(_.backend.render)
  .build
```

After:
```scala
class Backend($: BackendScope[Unit, State]) {
  def render(s: State) =   // ← Accept props, state and/or propsChildren as argument
    <.div(
      <.div(s.length, " items found:"),
      <.ol(s.map(i => <.li(i))))
}

val Example = ReactComponentB[Unit]("Example")
  .initialState(Vector("hello", "world"))
  .renderBackend[Backend]  // ← Use Backend class and backend.render
  .build
```

You can also create a backend yourself and still use `.renderBackend`:
```scala
val Example = ReactComponentB[Unit]("Example")
  .initialState(Vector("hello", "world"))
  .backend(new Backend(_)) // ← Fine! Do it yourself!
  .renderBackend           // ← Use backend.render
  .build
```

Using Components
================

Once you've created a Scala React component, it mostly acts like a typical Scala case class.
To use it, you create an instance.
To create an instance, you call the constructor.

```scala
val NoArgs =
  ReactComponentB[Unit]("No args")
    .render(_ => <.div("Hello!"))
    .build

val Hello =
  ReactComponentB[String]("Hello")
    .render_P(name => <.div("Hello there ", name))
    .build

// Usage
<.div(
  NoArgs(),
  Hello("John"),
  Hello("Jane"))
```

Component classes provides other methods:

| Method | Desc |
|--------|------|
| `withKey(js.Any)` | Apply a (React) key to the component you're about to instantiate. |
| `withRef(String | Ref)` | Attach a (React) reference to the component you're about to instantiate. |
| `set(key = ?, ref = ?)` | Alternate means of setting one or both of the above. |
| `reactClass` | The React component (constructor) in pure JS (i.e. without the Scala wrapping). |
| `withProps(=> Props)` | Using the given props fn, return a no-args component. |
| `withDefaultProps(=> Props)` | Using the given props fn, return a component which optionally accepts props in its constructor but also allows instantiation without specifying. |

Examples:

```scala
val Hello2 = Hello.withDefaultProps("Anonymous")

<.div(
  NoArgs.withKey("noargs-1")(),
  NoArgs.withKey("noargs-2")(),
  Hello2(),
  Hello2("Bob"))
```

#### Rendering

To render a component, it's the same as React. Use `ReactDOM.render` and specify a target in the DOM.

```scala
import org.scalajs.dom.document

ReactDOM.render(NoArgs(), document.body)
```

React Extensions
================

* Where `setState(State)` is applicable, you can also run `modState(State => State)`.

* Since `setState` and `modState` return callbacks, if you need to call them from outside of a component (e.g. by accessing the backend of a mounted component), call `.runNow()` to trigger the change; else the callback will never run.
  See the [Callbacks](#callbacks) section for more detail.

* `SyntheticEvent`s have numerous aliases that reduce verbosity.
  For example, in place of `SyntheticKeyboardEvent[HTMLInputElement]` you can use `ReactKeyboardEventI`.
  See [TYPES.md](TYPES.md) for details.

* React has a [classSet addon](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/class-name-manipulation.html)
  for specifying multiple optional class attributes. The same mechanism is applicable with this library is as follows:

  ```scala
  <.div(
    ^.classSet(
      "message"           -> true,
      "message-active"    -> true,
      "message-important" -> props.isImportant,
      "message-read"      -> props.isRead),
    props.message)

  // Or for convenience, put all constants in the first arg:
  <.div(
    ^.classSet1(
      "message message-active",
      "message-important" -> props.isImportant,
      "message-read"      -> props.isRead),
    props.message)
  ```

* Sometimes you want to allow a function to both get and affect a portion of a component's state. Anywhere that you can call `.setState()` you can also call `zoom()` to return an object that has the same `.setState()`, `.modState()` methods but only operates on a subset of the total state.

  ```scala
  def incrementCounter(s: CompState.Access[Int]): Callback =
    s.modState(_ + 1)

  // Then in some other component:
  case class State(name: String, counter: Int)

  def render = {
    val f = $.zoom(_.counter)((a,b) => a.copy(counter = b))
    button(onclick --> incrementCounter(f), "+")
  }
  ```

  You can cut down on boilerplate by using [Monocle](https://github.com/julien-truffaut/Monocle)
  and the [scalajs-react Monocle extensions](FP.md).
  By doing so, the above snippet will look like this:

  ```scala
  import monocle.macros._

  @Lenses case class State(name: String, counter: Int)

  def render = {
    val f = $ zoomL State.counter
    button(onclick --> incrementCounter(f), "+")
  }
  ```


Differences from React proper
=============================

* In React JS you access a component's children via `this.props.children`.
  In Scala, instances of `ComponentScope{U,M,WU}` and `BackendScope` provide a `.propsChildren` method.
  There is also a `.propsDynamic` method as a shortcut to access the children as a `js.Dynamic`.

* To keep a collection together when generating the dom, call `.toJsArray`. The only difference I'm aware of is that if the collection is maintained, React will issue warnings if you haven't supplied `key` attributes. Example:

  ```scala
  <.tbody(
    <.tr(
      <.th("Name"),
      <.th("Description"),
      <.th("Etcetera")),
    myListOfItems.sortBy(_.name).map(renderItem).toJsArray
  ```

* To specify a `key` when creating a React component, instead of merging it into the props,
  apply it to the component class as described in [Using Components](#using-components).

### Refs
Rather than specify references using strings, the `Ref` object can provide some more safety.

* `Ref(name)` will create a reference to both apply to and retrieve a plain DOM node.

* `Ref.to(component, name)` will create a reference to a component so that on retrieval its types are preserved.

* `Ref.param(param => name)` can be used for references to items in a set, with the key being a data entity's ID.

* Because refs are not guaranteed to exist, the return type is wrapped in `js.UndefOr[_]`. A helper method `tryFocus()` has been added to focus the ref if one is returned.

  ```scala
  val myRef = Ref[HTMLInputElement]("refKey")

  class Backend($: BackendScope[Props, String]) {
    def clearAndFocusInput(): Unit =
     $.setState("", () => myRef($).tryFocus())
  }
  ```

Using JS Components
===================

*Added in v0.9.2. Kindly contributed by [@imcharsi](https://github.com/imcharsi) - Thank you!*

First, let's create a simple example with only JavaScript, then convert it into scalajs-react example that uses Scala facades.

Below is `sampleReactComponent.js`.
```js
var SampleReactComponent = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {num:0,num2:0};
  },
  render: function() {
    return React.createElement("div", null, this.props.propOne);
  },
  getNum:function() {
    return this.state.num;
  },
  setNum:function(n) {
    this.setState({num:n});
  }
});
```

Below is `main.jsx`.
```js
var factory = React.createFactory(SampleReactComponent);
React.render(factory({propOne:"123"}), document.body);
```

First, copy JS Component library file that you want to use into Scala.JS resource directory.

Next, you need an SBT configuration like below.
You may want to see [here](http://www.scala-js.org/doc/sbt/depending.html).
(Feel free to change the `react-with-addons.js` filename according to your own case.)
```scala
jsDependencies += (ProvidedJS / "sampleReactComponent.js" dependsOn "react-with-addons.js")
```

Next, declare some Scala facades for your JS Components. You may want to see [here](http://www.scala-js.org/doc/calling-javascript.html) too.

```scala
trait SampleReactComponentProperty extends js.Object {
  val propOne: js.UndefOr[String] = js.native
}

trait SampleReactComponentState extends js.Object {
  val num: js.UndefOr[Int] = js.native
  val num2: js.UndefOr[Int] = js.native
}

@JSName("SampleReactComponent")
object SampleReactComponent
  extends JsComponentType[SampleReactComponentProperty, SampleReactComponentState, HTMLElement]

trait SampleReactComponentM
    extends JsComponentM[SampleReactComponentProperty, SampleReactComponentState, HTMLElement] {
  def getNum(): Int = js.native
  def setNum(n: Int): Unit = js.native
}
```

As with all Scala.JS facades, you will need some boilerplate code to act as a bridge between the JS and easier-to-use Scala. Below is an example of such boilerplate utility code:
```scala
object SampleReactComponentProperty {
  def apply(ref: js.UndefOr[String] = js.undefined, propOne: js.UndefOr[String] = js.undefined): SampleReactComponentProperty = {
    val p = js.Dynamic.literal()

    ref.foreach(p.updateDynamic("ref")(_))
    propOne.foreach(p.updateDynamic("propOne")(_))

    p.asInstanceOf[SampleReactComponentProperty]
  }
}

object SampleReactComponentState {
  def apply(prevState: SampleReactComponentState)(
    num: js.UndefOr[Int] = js.undefined,
    num2: js.UndefOr[Int] = js.undefined): SampleReactComponentState = {
    val p = js.Dynamic.literal()

    num.orElse(prevState.num).foreach(p.updateDynamic("num")(_))
    num2.orElse(prevState.num2).foreach(p.updateDynamic("num2")(_))

    p.asInstanceOf[SampleReactComponentState]
  }
}
```

Bow let's use the previously-mentioned `main.jsx` in scalajs-react.
In this example we'll wrap it in a Scala component with a Scala-based backend.

```scala
class XxxBackend(scope: BackendScope[Unit, Unit]) {
  def modifyOne(i: Int): Unit = {
    ref(scope).foreach(_.setNum(i))
  }

  def modifyTwo(i: Int): Unit = {
    ref(scope).foreach(c => c.setState(SampleReactComponentState(c.state)(num2 = i)))
  }
  ...
}

val ref = Ref.toJS[SampleReactComponentM]("ref123")

val component = ReactComponentB[Unit]("S").stateless.backend(new XxxBackend(_)).render { scope =>
  val factory = React.createFactory(SampleReactComponent)
  factory(SampleReactComponentProperty(ref = ref, propOne = "123"))
}.build

React.render(component(), dom.document.body)
```

From this point on, the usage is the same as with normal scalajs-react components.

**NOTE**: When creating a JS component's state facade, do not use `var`s, or at least do not modify them directly if you do.

For example, don't do this:
```scala
trait SampleReactComponentState extends js.Object {
  var num: js.UndefOr[Int] = js.native     // using var
}

mountedComponent.foreach(_.state.var = 1)  // BAD: don't modify directly
```

Instead, ensure you call `setState`. Example:
```scala
trait SampleReactComponentState extends js.Object {
  val num: js.UndefOr[Int] = js.native   // using val, not var
}

mountedComponent.foreach(c =>            // GOOD: call setState
  c.setState(SampleReactComponentState(c.state)(num2 = 1)))
```

Callbacks and Futures
=====================

There are a number of conversions available to convert between `Callback` and `Future`.

| Input                      | Method                 | Output                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `CallbackTo[A]`            | `cb.toFuture`          | `Future[A]`             |
| `CallbackTo[Future[A]]`    | `cb.toFlatFuture`      | `Future[A]`             |
| `=> Future[A]`             | `CallbackTo(f)`        | `CallbackTo[Future[A]]` |
| `=> Future[CallbackTo[A]]` | `CallbackTo.future(f)` | `CallbackTo[Future[A]]` |
| `=> Future[CallbackTo[A]]` | `Callback.future(f)`   | `Callback`              |

If you're looking for ways to block (eg. turning a `Callback[Future[A]]` into a `Callback[A]`),
it is not supported by Scala.JS (See [#1996](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/issues/1996)).

**NOTE:** It's important that when going from `Future` to `Callback`, you're aware of when the `Future` is instantiated.

```scala
def queryServer: Future[Data] = ???

def updateComponent: Future[Callback] =
  queryServer.map($ setState _)

// This is GOOD because the callback wraps the updateComponent *function*, not an instance.
Callback.future(updateComponent)

// This is BAD because the callback wraps a single instance of updateComponent.
// 1) The server will be contacted immediately instead of when the callback executes.
// 2) If the callback is executed more than once, the future and old result will be reused.
val f = updateComponent
Callback.future(f)

// This is GOOD too because the future is created inside the callback.
Callback.future {
  val f = updateComponent
  f.onComplete(???)
  f
}
```


Gotchas
=======

* `table(tr(...))` will appear to work fine at first then crash later. React needs `table(tbody(tr(...)))`.

* React's `setState` is asynchronous; it doesn't apply invocations of `this.setState` until the end of `render` or the current callback. Calling `.state` after `.setState` will return the initial, original value, i.e.

  ```scala
  val s1 = $.state
  val s2 = "new state"
  $.setState(s2)
  $.state == s2 // returns false
  $.state == s1 // returns true
  ```

  If this is a problem you have 2 choices.

  1. Use `modState`.
  2. Refactor your logic so that you only call `setState` once.
  3. Use Scalaz state monads as demonstrated in the online [state monad example](https://japgolly.github.io/scalajs-react/#examples/state-monad).

* Since `setState` and `modState` return callbacks, if you need to call them from outside of a component (e.g. by accessing the backend of a mounted component), call `.runNow()` to trigger the change; else the callback will never run.
  See the [Callbacks](#callbacks) section for more detail.

* Type-inference when creating vdom can break if you call a function whose return type is also infered.

  Example: `Option.getOrElse`.

  If you have an `Option[A]`, the return type of `getOrElse` is not always `A`.
  This is because the `A` in `Option` is covariant, and so instead of `getOrElse(default: => A): A`
  *(which would avoid this vdom type-inference problem)*, it's actually `getOrElse[B >: A](default: => B): B`.

  This confuses Scala:
  ```scala
  def problem(name: Option[String]) =
    <.div(^.title := name.getOrElse("No Name"))
  ```

  Workarounds:
  ```scala
  // Workaround #1: Move the call outside.
  def workaround1(nameOption: Option[String]) = {
    val name = nameOption getOrElse "No Name"
    <.div(^.title := name)
  }

  // Workaround #2: Specify the type manually.
  def workaround2(name: Option[String]) =
    <.div(^.title := name.getOrElse[String]("No Name"))
  ```
