    * @param actualDurationMs Time spent rendering the Profiler and its descendants for the current update. This indicates how well the subtree makes use of memoization (e.g. React.memo, useMemo, shouldComponentUpdate). Ideally this value should decrease significantly after the initial mount as many of the descendants will only need to re-render if their specific props change.
    * @param baseDurationMs Duration of the most recent render time for each individual component within the Profiler tree. This value estimates a worst-case cost of rendering (e.g. the initial mount or a tree with no memoization).
    * @param startTime Timestamp when React began rendering the current update.
    * @param commitTime Timestamp when React committed the current update. This value is shared between all profilers in a commit, enabling them to be grouped if desirable.
