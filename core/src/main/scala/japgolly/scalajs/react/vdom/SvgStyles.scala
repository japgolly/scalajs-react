    * 2px wide even when the user zooms into the map. To achieve this, SVG Tiny 1.2 introduces the 'vector-effect'
    * property. Future versions of the SVG language will allow for more powerful vector effects through this property
    * but this version restricts it to being able to specify the non-scaling stroke behavior

      * With the non-scaling-stroke vector effect, stroke outline shall be calculated in the "host" coordinate space
      * instead of user coordinate space. More precisely: a user agent establishes a host coordinate space which in
      * SVG Tiny 1.2 is always the same as "screen coordinate space". The stroke outline is calculated in the
      * following manner: first, the shape's path is transformed into the host coordinate space.
      * Stroke outline is calculated in the host coordinate space. The resulting outline is transformed back to the
      * user coordinate system. (Stroke outline is always filled with stroke paint in the current user space).
      * The resulting visual effect of this modification is that stroke width is not dependant on the transformations
      * of the element (including non-uniform scaling and shear transformations) and zoom level.
