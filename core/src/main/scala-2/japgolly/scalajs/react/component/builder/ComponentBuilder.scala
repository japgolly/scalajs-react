      *
      * This method exists for rare use cases where the state depends on changes in props over time.
      * For example, it might be handy for implementing a Transition component that compares its previous and next
      * children to decide which of them to animate in and out.
      *
      * Deriving state leads to verbose code and makes your components difficult to think about.
      * Make sure you're familiar with simpler alternatives:
      *
      *   - If you need to perform a side effect (for example, data fetching or an animation) in response to a change in
      *     props, use componentDidUpdate lifecycle instead.
      *
      *   - If you want to re-compute some data only when a prop changes, use a memoization helper instead.
      *
      *   - If you want to "reset" some state when a prop changes, consider either making a component fully controlled
      *     or fully uncontrolled with a key instead.
      *
      * Note that this method is fired on every render, regardless of the cause.
      * This is in contrast to componentWillReceiveProps, which only fires when the parent causes a re-render and
      * not as a result of a local setState.
